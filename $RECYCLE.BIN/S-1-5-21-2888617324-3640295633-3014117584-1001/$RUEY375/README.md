    If it is not the case, you have to modify the content of `package.bat` / `package.sh` to have the variables `PYTHON3` and `PIP3` pointing on the right location
    ```
    rem set PYTHON3=C:\Python37\python
    rem set PIP3=C:\Python37\Scripts\pip
    set PYTHON3=<Python 3.7 directory>\python
    set PIP3=<Python 3.7 directory>\Scripts\pip
    ```
